# Bot for quizlet live

A quick script I wrote turned into a Chrome extension. Probably full of bugs. You're finally able to have a good time in your swedish class :)

## Installation

In chrome extensions:

-   Enable Developer mode
-   Click `Load unpacked`
-   Select the `extension` folder in the project root directory
